# prime

prime strives to be your fully local (ollama) all in all terminal ai assistant.
prime can answer your questions, manage your terminal commands, play with files and prettymuch do everything else that can be scripted.
all of this on the smallest gemma3 model! prime achieves this by employing a brilliantly simple almost non existant agent communication protocol that is also extremely powerfull and versatile.
