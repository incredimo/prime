Wake up, check the feed, get your dopamine hit
Got a life-path subscription, a pre-approved kit
Got a five-star review for the smile that you rent
And your soul's a down payment on the first of the month's rent
Every thought is a headline, a targeted post
You're the host and the virus, the ghost in the host
Got a click-track for a pulse, a brand for a name
Just a player in a beta-test version of the game

 
They're sellin' you the hustle, sellin' you the ease
Sellin' you the sickness, sellin' the disease
Then they sell you the cure in a hundred-dollar squeeze
And you thank 'em for the privilege, down on your knees
They build a better cage and they call it a choice
Give you fifty million echoes but take away your voice
I've read the terms of service, I can see the final clause
It's an endless intermission with no reason for applause

(CHORUS)
(The curated emotion, the tactical plan)
(The god in the algorithm, the invisible hand)
(The pre-packaged rebellion you hold in your hand)
(The focus-grouped future they want you to stand for)
(No filter, no fiction, no grand design)
(Just a glitch in the mainline, a break in the line)
(It's a system crash error sayin' none of this is mine)
(I’m cuttin’ the connection — I officially decline)

(VERSE 2)
Buy a little zen in a shade of pale jade
Got your trauma monetized for a TED Talk tirade
Manifest a mansion while you're critically underpaid
Your inner-child's a target market, don't be afraid
To download your nirvana, just accept the new terms
Your chakras are a data point, the research confirms
They sell you mindfulness so you don't lose your mind
At the fact that you are running just to stay this far behind

(PRE-CHORUS)
They're sellin' you the problem, sellin' you the blame
Sellin' you the players and sellin' you the game
Sellin' you the fire, then sellin' you the rain
And the only thing that's different is the logo on the chain
They build a better product and they call it "The Truth"
They bottle up your childhood and sell you back your youth
I've seen the ending credits, I already know the gist
It's a story 'bout a story that doesn't exist

(CHORUS)
(The curated emotion, the tactical plan)
(The god in the algorithm, the invisible hand)
(The pre-packaged rebellion you hold in your hand)
(The focus-grouped future they want you to stand for)
(No filter, no fiction, no grand design)
(Just a glitch in the mainline, a break in the line)
(It's a system crash error sayin' none of this is mine)
(I’m cuttin’ the connection — I officially decline)

[BRIDGE]
[Music breaks down. The beat gets chopped and screwed. Vocals become more direct — almost spoken — dripping with venomous clarity.]
Even this rebellion is a demographic niche
A perfectly-honed, anti-establishment sales pitch
They'd bottle up this anger and sell it back to me
Label it 'Authentic Rage™', shipping is free
The only path to freedom is a sponsored escape
Your whole life is B-roll on someone else's tape
The puppet sees the strings but it still has to dance
Your only "choice" is picking out your final, desperate stance
And mine is...

(CHORUS)
(The curated emotion, the tactical plan)
(The god in the algorithm, the invisible hand)
(The pre-packaged rebellion you hold in your hand)
(The focus-grouped future they want you to stand for)
(No filter, no fiction, no grand design)
(Just a glitch in the mainline, a break in the line)
(It's a system crash error sayin' none of this is mine)
(I’m cuttin’ the connection — I officially decline)

[Spoken softly, minimal instrumental — fading out like static]
The punchline to a joke I was never told.

The story's getting old.
