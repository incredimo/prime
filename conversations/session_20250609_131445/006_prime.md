Okay, the error indicates an issue with the `oh-my-posh` module, which is likely causing the time retrieval to fail. Let's bypass that module and use a more direct method to get the time.

```{.script execute="Get-Date"}
```

*(I'm executing `Get-Date` directly to avoid the problematic `oh-my-posh` module.)*
