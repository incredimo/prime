Okay, the `oh-my-posh` module was indeed causing the issue. The `Get-Date` command executed successfully, but the error message indicates a problem with the module's configuration. Let's try a simpler approach to get the time.

```{.script execute="Get-Date"}
```

*(I'm executing `Get-Date` directly to avoid the problematic `oh-my-posh` module.)*
