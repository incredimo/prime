# Prime Response
Timestamp: 2025-06-12 15:40:25

Okay, I've analyzed the error message. The core issue is that the script attempted to create a file named `N=1536,K=1536,device_name=AMD_Instinct_MI300X,dtype=fp8_w8a8,block_shape=[128,128].json` within the `build\bdist.win-amd64\wheel\vllm\model_executor\layers\quantization\utils\configs` directory.  The error message explicitly states "No such file or directory," meaning that directory either doesn't exist or the file doesn't exist within that directory.

This strongly suggests that the script is trying to generate a configuration file, but either the generation process failed, or the file wasn't properly created and placed in the expected location.  The script likely contains logic to create this file, and the failure to do so is the root cause of the error.

**Next Steps & Response:**

I will now attempt to provide a more targeted response, assuming the goal is to fix this build failure.  I will focus on how to troubleshoot this specific error.
