Okay, I can help you install vLLM. This will involve a few steps, and I'll guide you through it.

First, I'll create a Python environment and install the necessary dependencies.

```{.script execute="pip install vllm" }
```
*(System executes the `pip install vllm` command. The output of this command (e.g., the list of packages installed, any errors) will be sent back to me.)*
